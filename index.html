								<p>I am a senior of computer science at VSU. I am currently employed as a Software Engineer I at CDK Global. I enjoy playing video games, walking trails, and playing card games.</p>
								<p>I am currently engaged to the love of my life, Jessica. I have been with her for over 6 years. You could definitely call it a high school sweetheart.</p>

							<article id="objective">
								<h2 class="major">Objective</h2>								
								<p>I currently do not have any job seeking objectives as I have already landed the position I would want to apply for. If I were to apply elsewhere, it would have to be because I find displacement at my current work place.</p>

						<!-- About -->
							<article id="experience">
								<h2 class="major">Coding/Work Experience</h2>								
								<p>Ever since highschool, I have had a love for coding. I would frequently join in the TSA coding comptetions. My team and I finished 3rd in state to advance to nationals where we did not perform as highly as expected. The language that we used was Python 3.</p>
								<p>Since then, college has allowed me to learn more programming languages than I could have hoped for. From my courses I have learned Java, C, Python and HTML/CSS.</p>
								<p>From my work experience, I have learned C#, ASP.NET, JavaScript, and SQL. Work is the only place I have done any major projects. I have made web applications that are required for the Call Center to activate dealerships for Inbound calls.</p>
								<p>I have not had any teaching, research, or hackathon experience with anything related to my subject.</p>
